### Projects

Analysis of the Austin Housing Market – R Project	 Spring 2023
•	Created summary statistics for numeric, categorical variables, and manipulated data sets to fit in a linear regression model
•	Produced two visualizations of the data, including a plot with one variable, another with two variables, and one with three variables

Elements of Programming in Python – Python Project Spring 2023
•	Built a Python system to extract and process population data for 500 Texas cities from a CSV file
•	Designed and implemented an algorithm to process user input and output corresponding results based on queried population data

Predicting Ambient Air Pollution Concentrations Across the Continental United States - R Project Spring 2023
•	Employed a diverse range of modeling approaches, including Gradient Boosting Regression, Linear Regression, NNETAR, and Random Forest regression, to predict ambient air pollution concentrations across the Continental United States.
•	Conducted a comprehensive analysis of variable correlations using a correlation matrix to identify top predictors for the models.
•	Generated a correlation table featuring values between 0 and 1 to quantify relationships between various dataset variables, facilitating the selection of key predictors.
•	Employed a data-driven approach to select the top 20 variables with the highest correlation coefficients to optimize model performance
